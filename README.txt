This is a submission to the Amazon Node Classificiation Challenge held at July 2021, to which our team secured a rank of 200 over 4000 participants all over the country. 
The Dataset is currently not on any online server. Contact if required. The dataset can also be found in Kaggle (i will upload the link later).
